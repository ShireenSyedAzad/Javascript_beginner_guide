# Console Group
**console.group() and its associated method **console.groupCollapsed(). These two methods let you control the grouping and collapsibility of messages logged to the browser console using the JavaScript console API.

First, consider our initial demonstration program, which logs three informational messages:
```
console.log('Message 1');
console.log('Message 2');
console.log('Message 3');
```
Now, suppose we want to group these messages together under a heading of our choosing. We accomplish this goal by wrapping these log calls inside an instance of console.group(), passing in a descriptive label or name for the group. When we run the modified code snippet below, each statement should now display as a tree node in the browser's development tools area. You may expand or collapse individual groups by clicking their header contents.
```
console.group('My Group Label');
console.log('Message 1');
console.log('Message 2');
console.log('Message 3');
console.groupEnd();
```
Alternatively, we might choose to keep groups hidden until expanded manually. In practice, such folded sections are beneficial when dealing with large amounts of data or many topics being actively tracked. To achieve this effect, simply replace the closing **console.groupEnd() statement with another **console.groupCollapsed() declaration instead:

console.group('My Hidden Group Label');
console.log('Some content here...');
console.groupCollapsed('More text goes here...');
console.log('And even further...');
console.groupEnd();
Both techniques allow us to manage complex console outputs with greater flexibility and organization while maintaining readability and ease of interaction for users browsing through long log streams. Try out different combinations of console.group() and **console.groupCollapsed() statements to refine your logging workflow today!# 

# Console timers
 **Console timers are useful for measuring performance during development and debugging sessions. One simple way to implement timing logic using the console.time()/console.timeEnd() syntax involves wrapping a section of code inside two calls to the **console.time() and **console.timeEnd() functions respectively, where you calculate elapsed time between each pair of logs

 # console.log() 
Prints out a stringified version of a given value along with newlines. Its primary usage is for displaying informational messages to help developers better understand the state of their programs. This method is often utilized when debugging, but it can also be used for simple visual output display or progress indicators in the case of larger projects. It helps developers see how their data transforms across different iterations in real-time, helping them keep track of various parts of the app or script.
# console.warn() 
Similar to console.log(), however it prints out warnings instead of regular messages, allowing developers to highlight potential issues early on and take corrective action before they become critical problems. Implementations vary depending on the framework or library used, but in general, warnings indicate areas likely to cause trouble down the road, such as deprecated code or improper configurations. When encountered during development, warnings should be addressed proactively since neglecting them could result in unexpected errors, loss of functionality, or security vulnerabilities later on.
# console.error() 
Used to showcase significant errors preventing scripts from executing properly. Typically, these occur due to invalid data formats, undefined variables, syntax mistakes, or incorrect callback logic. Since errors block normal program execution and require immediate attention, the console displays detailed error messages pointing towards probable sources of failure. Correctly identifying and resolving errors caught by console.error() helps ensure smooth overall performance for both users and applications.
# console.table()
Displays an array or matrix structure, offering additional formatting beyond basic stringification. Utilizing t
